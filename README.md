# Sunscan-Crompton-Variant
Inspired by the Staros Projects Sunscan spectro heliograph my version uses second hand M39 75mm enlarger lenses and a stopped down 50mm objective.

The primary difference between the official Sunscan and this one is the use of M39 75mm enlarger lenses for the collimator and the camera lenses. I also use a 50mm objective lens from a finderscope I had lying around. This is stopped down to 25mm.

Another difference is that I had previously bought a micrometer adjustable turntable in preparation for an attempt at the PVC spectro heligraph (https://github.com/terawats/PVC_Spectroheliograph) so I decided to incorporate that too. This also necessitated a different approach to how the defraction grating is adjusted. It is now ajusted using a single M3 machine screw accessed through the window behind the grating holder.

The M39 75mm enlarger lenses I picked up off ebay for Â£20 the pair. One is a Hoya Super EL 75mm f1:4.5 the other is a Schneider - Kreuznach 75mm f1:4.0. Will they work? I don't know but half the fun is finding out.

The model is created in the Autodesk Fusion (Personal use) version. I will occassionally update the Fusion Archives folder with the latest archive. Print Files will be updated as and when the are updated. The other folders just contain images and animations from Fusion.
